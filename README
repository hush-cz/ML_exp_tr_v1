# ML Research Experiments

This repository contains small-scale experiments related to machine learning research, 
focusing on large language models (LLMs), reinforcement learning (RL), and AI safety.

## Project 1: Prompt Consistency Experiment
- **Goal:** Test how consistent a language model is when answering fact-based questions with different prompt formulations.
- **Method:** Using HuggingFace Transformers (DistilGPT-2) to generate answers for multiple prompt variants.
- **Results:** Simple analysis of consistency rate.
- **Notebook:** [Prompt_Consistency_Experiment.ipynb](notebooks/Prompt_Consistency_Experiment.ipynb)

More experiments coming soon (e.g., RL agent training with PPO in CartPole). (I hope :D)
